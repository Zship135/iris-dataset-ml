# Machine Learning with the Iris Dataset

### Problem Statement

The Iris Dataset is probably the most popular beginner project in machine learning. It was collected in 1936 and contains 50 samples of petal length and width, and sepal length and width of Iris flowers. The dataset is small, clean, and easy to work with. The goal of the project is to use machine learning (ML) to make a predictive model, given sample measurements, as to which species the sample is. The Iris Dataset is like a sandbox for testing ML models and statistical methods. It also proves useful for learning visualization.
